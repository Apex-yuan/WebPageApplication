@par Hardware and Software environment

  This example requires :
    - a 3D printer board
    - a client device with WIFI and an internet navigator such as chrome, internet explorer or firefox
    - max 512Kbytes of files in the pages folder (wifi module limitation)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to use the web page, you must do the following :
 - Either use the provided outfile.img image file or create one
 - Copy this file in a web server
 - Retrieve the file over-the-air using the 
   AT+S.HTTPDFSUPDATE=<hostname>,<path>[,port] command
   with a terminal connected to 3d printer debug uart.
     - <hostname>: external web server. DNS resolvable name or IP address
     - <path>: document path
     - <port>: target host port
 - Reset the 3d printer wifi module by typing AT+CFUN=1
 - From the wifi client device, open up a navigator and type 
   <3d printer wifi module ip address>/3dprinter.shtml
   
 - How to create a new outfile.img:
     - run the gen.bat
     - the new outfile.img replaces the old one in the pages directory
